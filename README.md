This is a project i started when i was 3 weeks into javaScript, i actually started it by the second week of my JavaScript course. When i started html and css course i immediately fell in love with them because i like anything that has to do with designing and building but after adding JavaScript to my module and and being told and taught what i could achieve with it, i got more curious and i always want to learn more and create wonders; one thing i love about __JavaScript__ is that it gives you an insight of something, wanting you to think better and that's why whenever i'm in my JavaScript class and learning a topic i always wants to build something from it:

I'm interested in learning new things especially when it's about Html, Css and JavaScript.
